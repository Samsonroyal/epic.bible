### Disclaimer
The vision of Epic Bible is to provide a smooth, and first-class and high-performance experience
to the study of the Word of God for free. The source-code is open and you can take and use it as you need to.

Whereas Epic Bible is free to use and re-use, we will offer some paid features at a relatively low cost to cover the expenses of hosting
the application and to support the team that works hard to maintain the Epic Bible Application. Epic Bible however, will
still offer a generous portion of it's consumption for the free study of the Word of God.
