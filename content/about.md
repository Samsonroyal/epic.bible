# About Epic Bible

[Return Home](/)

Hi üëãüèΩ! My name is Jonathan. Welcome to Epic Bible!

I'm building the Epic Bible Application to help me study the Bible conveniently. When studying the Word, I value speed, and accessibility when looking for scriptures.

## Why you should try Epic Bible

- Beautiful, non-obtrusive user interface
- Parallel versions view
- Quick search for scriptures
- Dark and Light Mode

### Why Epic Bible

I love to study the scriptures. Usually I'll use my phone/tablet or physical Bible to read the scriptures. As I read, I often need to do an advanced search for a passage or reference.

I'll typically turn to an online Bible to help me with this. However, most online will Bibles bombard me with ads before I can get to the scripture I want. Those extra clicks take away from the experience of studying the Word, and can be distracting.

So I set out to build something that is snappy and immersinve and enjoyable to use!

<br />

Once I finish the above features, I may build a few personalization features:

- Note taking
- History tracking
- Greek / Hebrew Lexicon
- Audio
