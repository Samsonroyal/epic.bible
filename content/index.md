# Welcome to Epic Bible!

Hi üëãüèΩ! My name is Jonathan. I am building Epic Bible to help me study the Bible conveniently. When studying the Word, I value
speed, and accessibility when looking for scriptures.

Even though I use my phone/tablet or physical Bible to read the scriptures, I often need to do an advanced search for a scripture.
I'll typically turn to an online Bible to help me with this. However, most online will Bibles bombard me with ads before I can get to the scripture I want. Those extra clicks take away from the experience of studying the Word, and can be distracting.

So I set out to build something that is snappy and immersinve and enjoyable to use!

## Features
- Beautiful, non-obtrusive user interface
- Parallel versions view
- Quick search for scriptures
- Dark and Light Mode


<br />

Once I finish the above features, I may build a few personalization features:
- Note taking
- History tracking
- Audio
